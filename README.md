# Homework 3

Create a command line application that reads various "commands" from the
stdin, evaluates them, and writes output to stdout.

Commands are:
```
divide 4 5
```  
which should output `4 divided by 5 is 0.8`

```
sum 5 5 6 8.5
```
which should output `the sum of 5 5 6 8.5 is 24.5`

```
average 4 3 8.5 4
```
which should output `the average of 4 3 8.5 4 is 4.875`

```
min 4 -3 -17
```
which should output `the minimum of 4 -3 -17 is -17`

```
max 4 -3 -17
```
which should output `the maximum of 4 -3 -17 is 4`

In case of commands that cannot be parsed or calculations that cannot be performed,
output a single line starting with `Error: `
